    <p style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; text-align:center; color: #005000;">Visit UAE to find a Job</p>

<p>At <b>Aj 1st Consultants</b>, we provide a reliable, structured pathway for candidates seeking job opportunities in the UAE. We offer support tailored to different skill levels, assisting both experienced professionals and unskilled job seekers. Our goal is to help you transition smoothly, whether you’re here to secure your own job or work through opportunities arranged by us.</p>

<hr>

<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #005000;">How Our Service Works</p>

<p>We offer a <b>60-day visit visa package</b> that includes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Visa and Flight Arrangements:</b> We handle all paperwork for a 60-day UAE visit visa, along with flight tickets.</li>
    <li><b>Accommodation and Food:</b> We provide accommodation and daily meals during your initial stay, giving you a stable base while you focus on finding the right job.</li>
    <li><b>Transport and Interviews:</b> Transport to interviews is included. If you are skilled and experienced, we will arrange interview opportunities for you, but it is your responsibility to succeed in these interviews. For those without specific skills or experience, we will assign jobs as they become available.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-align:center; color: #005000;">For Skilled and Experienced Candidates</p>

<p>If you already possess the skills and experience needed in the UAE job market, our service provides:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Accommodation and Meals:</b> Provided for up to 60 days, giving you time to secure your own job.</li>
    <li><b>Interview Arrangements:</b> We will arrange job interviews relevant to your skills. However, passing the interview is entirely up to you.</li>
</ul>

<p style="background-color:#f0f0f0; padding:10px; border-left:4px solid #005000; font-style:italic;">
    <b>Note:</b> If you do not secure a job within the 60-day period, any additional visa renewals or exit arrangements, as well as extended accommodation, will be at your expense.
</p>

<hr>

<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-align:center; color: #005000;">For Unskilled or Inexperienced Candidates</p>

<p>If you are new to the workforce or do not have specific experience, we will work closely with you to place you in an available position. Our support includes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Job Placement:</b> We will assign you to suitable job openings as they become available.</li>
    <li><b>Accommodation, Meals, and Transportation:</b> Provided until you secure employment.</li>
</ul>

<p style="background-color:#f0f0f0; padding:10px; border-left:4px solid #005000; font-style:italic;">
    <b>Important:</b> Until you start your job, all basic needs—housing, food, and local transport—will be covered by us.
